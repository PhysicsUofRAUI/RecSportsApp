# RecSportsApp
This is a database application that is meant to track stats for sports leagues. This is aimed for rec sports leagues (aka beer leagues) because some of them do not have a easy way to track stats and such. Hopefully the work done here will help those leagues track their stats!

# Current Situation
Just starting out. All that has been done so far is a rough database sketch and the creation of this repo.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to make a ready to go database application that people can use to easily track the stats and standings of their league. Hopefully this can be done with minimal technical expertise so that it can be easily set up by people who are not very technical. This hopefully can be done by giving detailed instructions on how to host a website. Then just have it so they could upload all the necessary documents and use an easy web interface to add stats. After that the website is just generated around the stats.

That is the rough idea.

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute. At this moment there is not much concrete to contribute on but hopefully soon that will change.
