# How to start contributing

At the moment the way to raise an idea for a new the project is just to raise an issue. The is some possible features listed in the issues section already.
If you want to work on one of the issues please comment on it and then people will know what is being worked on. 

# Top Priorities
1. Decide on a final database structure. 
2. Make a rough outline of what the website and administrator interface will look like.
3. Make the final decision on what technologies should be used.

After these are complete then the build will begin.

# Who can contribute
Anyone can. Most of the people currently involved in the project are very inexperienced with open source projects so we are of course friendly with beginers since we are beginers. Experienced people are also very welcome, since it would be great to get some people involved who have done this before. 

Thanks for reading and stay tuned for updates!
